## Introduction
#### I was born in the year 1996 in Taipei. In primary school, I studied at a school in Brisbane for 2 years and this greatly helped raise my English proficiency. I went to Germany after returning to Taiwan and it sparked my interest in language learning. I started learning German when I was in last year in elementary school. Which helped when I wanted to go to Germany for a exchange student programme.
#### During high school, some infosec news went viral and I started noticing news regarding to information security. Then came the news of a Bitcoin exchange founded in Japan which lured me into researching about Blockchains and Fintech.
#### I started programming in high school, then I got interested in finance and management. So I applied for Management Information Systems Department. In the second year, I wrote a simple web app for managing inventory and wrote a Line Bot using their v1 API. Currently in my third year, I am developing an application for choosing stocks by mining open data from the stock exchange and using machine learning to try to classify. I am also helping a friend with making programming learning website by configuring Dockerfiles and writing Shell scripts for isolating code written by users online.
